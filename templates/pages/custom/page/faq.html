        What material is the cutting board made from?

          <div class="info">
            <p class="text">All of our plastic cutting boards are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic. HDPE is a formulated non-porous, high density material for food processing applications designed with superior scratch resistance. It will not absorb moisture, bacteria, or odors. It will not chip or peel and is dishwasher-safe. HDPE is not altered by chemicals, moisture, or impact which makes it ideal for such a wide range of applications.</p>

            <p class="text">Textured HDPE plastic is most commonly referred to as plastic cutting board material and can be cut into any custom shape and size determined by the consumer and the application. The non-porous surface is not slippery and prevents the users knife from going dull after repeated use, which makes for an ideal cutting surface for food application. Additionally, the boards are textured on both sides so that they can be used on either side, extending their longevity. While smooth HDPE is still considered food safe, it is not as ideal for cutting or preparing food the way that textured HDPE is.</p>

            <br>

            <ul class="text">
              <li>Orders <strong>UNDER $75.00</strong> and within the standard size dimensions and weight qualify for a <strong>FLAT $6.00 RATE</strong> for standard shipping.</li>
              <li>Orders <strong>OVER $75.00</strong> and within the standard size dimensions and weight qualify for <strong>FREE</strong> standard shipping.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text">Our site will automatically offer the most affordable packing for your order and may split your order into multiple packages to offer you the best shipping rate. If the item(s) in your cart is/are estimated to be dimensionally oversize, your shipping quote will include a large package surcharge. In many oversize cases, simply reducing the dimensions of the board by just a few inches may return standard size rates. If ordering a large board, it is often recommended to purchase two separate boards (each half of the desired length) to be placed next to each other in order to minimize the shipping costs caused by the large package surcharge.</p>
