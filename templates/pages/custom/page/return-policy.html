    <h1>Return Policy</h1>

    <h6 class="subheading">Returns</h6>
    <p>Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your purchase, unfortunately we can't offer you a refund or exchange.</p>


    <p>To be eligible for a return, you must receive prior authorization from the company. You can contact us by phone at <a href="tel:18006273010">1-800-627-3010</a> or by email at <a href="mailto:ecom@plastic-craft.com">ecom@plastic-craft.com</a> to request a return. Your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it.</p>

    <p><em>All sales on custom items are final</em>. This includes custom cutting boards.</p>

    <p>We charge a 15% restocking fee on all returned items.</p>

    <p class="extra-margin">To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

    <h6 class="subheading">Refunds (if applicable)</h6>
    <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.</p>

    <p class="extra-margin">If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 2 days.</p>   

    <h6 class="subheading">Late or missing refunds (if applicable)</h6>
    <p class="extra-margin">If you haven't received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, as it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you've done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at <a href="mailto:ecom@plastic-craft.com">ecom@plastic-craft.com</a>.</p>

    <h6 class="subheading">Exchanges (if applicable)</h6>
    <p class="extra-margin">We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange an item for the same product, send us an email at <a href="mailto:ecom@plastic-craft.com">ecom@plastic-craft.com</a> and send your item to: 744 West Nyack Road West Nyack New York US 10994.</p>

    <h6 class="subheading">Shipping</h6>
    <p>To return your product, you should mail your product to: 744 West Nyack Road West Nyack New York US 10994</p>

    <p class="extra-margin">You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping and handling costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the shipping and handling cost of return will be deducted from your refund. Depending on where you live, the time it takes for your exchanged product to reach you may vary. If you are shipping an item over $75, you should consider using a trackable shipping service or purchasing shipping insurance. We can't guarantee that we will receive your returned item so you may want to insure the return.</p>
